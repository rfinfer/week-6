/* ================================
Week 6 Assignment: Basic Application

Take a look at the midterm prototype: https://marvelapp.com/bf2c9h/screen/10434841
Try clicking on the "Next" and "Previous" buttons. This task will ask you to write some functions
that will enable us to write an application like in the midterm.

Write three functions: clickNextButton, clickPreviousButton, and saySlideName.
clickNextButton and clickPreviousButtons should simulate what will happen when someone clicks
on a next or previous button in your application.

You don't need to create HTML buttons or a useable applicationâ€”this exercise is asking you to create
functions that will be used in your application. To test it out, try calling the functions in your
console. For example, try running: clickNextButton() and see what it does. Use lots of console logs!

var state = {
  "slideNumber": 0, // slideNumber keeps track of what slide you are on. It should increase when you
                    // click the next button and decrease when you click the previous button. It
                    // should never get so large that it is bigger than the dataset. It should never
                    // get so small that it is smaller than 0.
  "slideData": [
    {
      "name": "How the Air Campaign Against ISIS Grew",
      "description": "The American-led air campaign against the Islamic State began as a limited operation, but quickly grew into what officials said will be a multi-year effort to destroy the group that will require local forces on the ground."
    },
    {
      "name": "A Limited Operation Begins",
      "language": "President Obama approves targeted strikes to protect Americans in Erbil and to help members of the Yazidi minority trapped by ISIS on Mount Sinjar. He stresses that the mission is limited and that he will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq."
    },
    {
      "name": "A New Location Is Targeted",
      "description": "American airstrikes help Iraqi forces reclaim Mosul Dam. President Obama says the limited operation is necessary to protect Americans in Baghdad, 290 miles away, who would be threatened if the dam broke."
    }
  ]
};

var clickNextButton = function(event) {
  if (state.slideNumber<state.slideData.length) {
    state.slideNumber = state["slideNumber"] + 1;
  };
  console.log("slideNumber", state.slideNumber);
};


//thing.click(clickNextButton)
var clickPreviousButton = function() {
  if (state.slideNumber >0) {
    state.slideNumber = state["slideNumber"] - 1;
  }
  console.log("slideNumber2", state.slideNumber);
};

var saySlideName = function(slide) {

  console.log("the value of slide is", slide.name);
  // console.log("state.slideData.name");
  // saySlideName uses console.log to "say" the name of the slide it is given. It should run when
  // someone clicks on one of the buttons.
}

var secondSlide = state.slideData[1]
saySlideName(secondSlide);

var thirdSlide = state.slideData[2]
saySlideName(thirdSlide);

var sayCurrentSlideName = function() {
  var slideDataPlace = state["slideNumber"]
  console.log(state.slideData[slideDataPlace].name);
}
